caption:  The first augmented desk system, the DigitalDesk, was built in the early 90s by Pierre Wellner at Xerox EuroPARC. A camera
mounted above the desk surface, so-called over-desk video, is used to track a user’s interaction with documents lying on the desk as shown in Figure (a).
Figure (b) shows the Digital-Desk Calculator, a specific application implemented on top of the DigitalDesk architecture. A calculator is projected onto the desk surface and the user can work with it as with a regular electronic calculator. An over-desk camera tracks the user’s finger and a number can be entered by touching the projected number buttons.
